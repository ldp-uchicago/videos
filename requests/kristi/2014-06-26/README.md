Kristi Schonwald would like me to make a specified list of LDP visit video files available to Perla Gamez for download from off-campus on a temporary basis.

I set up access to the requested videos [here](http://joy.uchicago.edu/ldp/videos/perla/).

I notified Perla and Kristi of their availability and requested notice once they've been downloaded so I can remove access.


# Requested Videos

Perla needs the `KG_1_07` visit video from `/project/sgsg/ldp/videos/visits/group-1/period-2`:

    61
    65
    72
    73
    75
    77
    81
    82
    83
    84
    87
    92
    100
    102
    103
    105
    107
    109
    119
    125
    127


## Notes

I couldn’t find any `KG_1_07` video files for subject 83.  We have …

    83.KG_1_06.T1.mov
    83.KG_1_06.T2.mov
    83.KG_2_07.T1.mov
    83.KG_2_07.T2.mov
    83.KG_2_08.T2.mov
    83.KG_2_08.T3.mov
    83.KG_3_07.T1.mov
    83.KG_3_07.T2.mov

Kristi also included `64.KG_1_08.*` but I couldn't locate any such videos.  I copied over the videos for `64.KG_1_07` as well as `1G_1_08`.
