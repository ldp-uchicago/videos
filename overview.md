# LDP Visit Videos

This directory contains [LDP](http://ldp.uchicago.edu) visit videos.  

The collection is organized by our two distinct subject groupings:

* `group-1` - normally-developing subjects

* `group-2` - brain-injured subjects

Visits for both groups of subjects were made over three distinct periods:

* `period-1`: 14 to 58 months (observations occurred at 4 month intervals)

* `period-2`: KG to 4G (observations made 3 times each year)

* `period-3`: 5G to 9G

Each period is unique in its observational protocol (described below).


## Period 1: Preschool visits

*12 visit sessions from 14 to 58 months*

The observations made within this period were originally known as the "home visits".  The first observations were made when subjects were 14 months of age and continued at four month intervals up to 58 months of age, for a total of 12 visit sessions.

    VISIT  MONTH 
    -----  ----- 
    1      14    
    2      18    
    3      22    
    4      26    
    5      30    
    6      34    
    7      38    
    8      42    
    9      46    
    10     50    
    11     54    
    12     58    

Each Period 1 visit video has a filename based on the following schema: `SUBJECT.SESSION.TAPE.mov`.  For example, the file `group-2/period-1/114.04.T2.mov` contains video from the second tape (`T2`) of the fourth session visit (`04`) for subject `114`. 


## Period 2: Elementary school visits

*visits from grades KG to 4G*

The observations made within this period were originally known as the "literacy visits".  The first observations were made when subjects were entering kindergarten (`KG`) and continued through fourth grade (`4G`).

Observations were taken three times each year:

1. fall (sep-oct)
2. winter (jan-feb)
3. spring (may-jun)

The visits were done in the families' homes, and included measures given to the children to assess reading, math and spatial skills.  Experimenter-elicited talk was also collected from the child during narrative tasks as was spontaneous conversation between experimenter and child.  

Each Period 2 visit video has a filename based on the following schema: `SUBJECT.SESSION.TAPE.mov`.  For example, the file `group-1/period-2/22.KG_3_07.T1.mov` contains video from the second tape (`T2`) of the third kindergarten visit (`KG_3`) for subject `22`. 


## Period 3: Middle school visits

*visits from grades 5 to 9*

The observations for this period are currently being collected.  We will observe subjects from grades five to nine.  The observations will consist of parent-child interaction over activities designed to elicit higher order thinking as well as experimenter-child interactions over similar activities.  In addition, standardized and homegrown measures were given to children and parents to measure skills relevant to higher order thinking.
