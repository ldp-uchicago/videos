# LDP Video Archive

The University of Chicago's [Language Development Project](http://ldp.uchicago.edu) is a longitudinal study that has received funding from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development since 2002. Its main research goal is to explore the extent and the limits of the language-learning process in young children. 

The LDP is currently using Midway to store their video archives.  Susan Goldin-Meadow is the PI (`pi-sgsg`).  The video archives can be found in the group's shared project space: `/project/sgsg/ldp`. 

Note that the project space is currently shared with the [Goldin-Meadow Lab](https://goldin-meadow-lab.uchicago.edu/) headed by SGM: `/project/sgsg/lab`.  (The LDP has provided a portion of the funding for Susan's overall allocation.)  They are using this directory to store [their own video archive](https://github.com/rcc-uchicago/sgm-video-archive).

The LDP would like to make these video archives both discoverable and accessible 
to a larger research community: linguists, anthropologists, and developmental scientists studying language acquisition, grammaticalization, etc.

One of Susan Goldin-Meadow's collaborators, Diane Brentari, is also interested in preserving her sign language video archives and making them accessible in a similar manner.

Note that most developmental scientists rely on video recordings to capture the complexity and richness of behavior. However, they rarely share video data due to IRB restristictions and the technical complexity involved in making archival content discoverable and accessible.
